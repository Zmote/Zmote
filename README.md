# Welcome
I'm an IT professional with a primary focus on web applications. A curious fellow with a broad set of interests, mostly to the detriment to my social life.

Some things about me:
- I'm a cat daddy 🐈
- To the question, how many monitors do you need, my answer is usually: YES! My current main setup looks like this:
  - ⬛🖥️⬛
  - 🖥️⬛🖥️
  - 🖥️🖥️🖥️
  - ⬛🖥️⬛  
- All things story-telling intrigue me
- I think I have informatino ADHD (can't get those open tabs under 40+)

## What you'll find here
This is my scratch space / testing grounds. I like to experiment with new technologies, learn new things, advance my knowledge in all things IT. And this is the primary space where I do those things.
Complex IT systems intrigue me, from the conception, design down to its implementation. A continous learner at heart, I thrive on challenges and love all things problem solving.
