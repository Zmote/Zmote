## Welcome to my Scratch Space / Testing Grounds

This is my scratch space / testing grounds, so it is very likely you'll find unfinished projects, don't judge me ðŸ˜³. I like to experiment with new technologies, learn new things, advance my knowledge in all things IT.
Complex IT systems intrigue me, from the conception, design down to its implementation. I'm still trying to get into open source contribution, trying to find the time and the right project.
